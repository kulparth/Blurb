# Blurb

A simple programmatic way to Blurb about myself!

The output of the notebook reads as below

---

Parth's no Neo or Zuck but he codes and re-codes

Parth's current focus is on ['Data - Big & Small', 'Data Science']

Parth worked across industries such as ['Finance (FinTech|PropTech)', 'Social Media', 'Ad-Tech', 'E-Commerce', 'SemiConductor Manufacturing']

Although not a web developer, but Parth designed and built a web app https://www.dc3rn.com from the ground up and blogs and shares his learnings. He hosts this app on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) so he knows a little bit about GCP

Parth programs in ['Python', 'Pandas', 'PySpark', 'NodeJS'] on ['Linux variants']

Parth worked on and uses any of these dbs ['aws-rds|mysql', 'ms*sqlserver', 'aws-redshift', 'mongodb', 'oracle', 'teradata', 'greeeplum']

Parth has worked on ['Hadoop', 'Hive', 'Docker', 'HTML5', 'CSS3', 'Bootstrap', 'Express', 'Laravel']

Parth uses aws stack but not limited to it such as ['S3', 'Athena |Presto', 'Kinesis', 'Glue', 'Lambda', 'IAM', 'EC2', 'Cloudwatch', 'AWS CLI |SAM', 'SNS', 'SES', 'EMR', '...use as needed']

Parth mostly uses ['macbook']

Parth uses code editors such as ['visual studio code', 'sublime', 'atom', 'vim', 'jupiter-notebook']

Parth relies on the elegance of the ['git']

Parth looks up to heros such as ['Musk', 'Sunder', 'Satya', 'Zuck', 'Systrome', 'Linus', '...many more']

Parth can continue but that won't really be a Blurb
